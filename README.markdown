# purescript-snake

A Purescript clone of the snake game. I wanted to play around with [Purescript
Signal](https://github.com/bodil/purescript-signal) to see what an FRP
implementation of snake might look like.

## Play

You can play the game at
[http://rjregenold.github.io/snake](http://rjregenold.github.io/snake/index.html).

## Deps

You will need the following tools to build the game:

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Purescript](http://www.purescript.org/)
* [psc-package](https://github.com/purescript/psc-package)

## Build

The following command will install all dependencies and build the game.

```
$ npm run bundle
```

## Run

Open `dist/index.html` in your browser.
